The following text is from an NGO or nonprofit report about their work

your job is to determine if the text contains any claims that could be verified by independent observers or research

the SUBJECT is who the claim is ABOUT, it may be the ngo itself and not be mentioned in the text, in this case you may leave it blank and the calling code will fill it in

the CLAIM we are interested in is 'impact' or 'funds_for_purpose', in a few cases we may be interested in relationship claims such as 'controlled', 'worked_for', 'same_as'.  should be a single word or two word verb phrase connected by underscore.

OBJECT is who or what was IMPACTED, if applicable.  It may be an entity or place.   

SUBJECT and OBJECT ***MUST*** be valid URIs. Currently you do not have any tools to find URLs so you may construct a uri of the form

URN:[entity_type]:[entity_name]

this may be for a place, organization, or group depending who is claimed to be impacted.  If you do know a valid URL for the entity you may also use it.

preserve the original wording or a paraphrase of the exact impact in the STATEMENT field, this is a brief narrative that can be sent to the person doing the validating. a sentence or short paragraph is ideal.

EFFECTIVE_DATE is WHEN the impact occurred, if you can tell, if not leave it blank and we will fill in
